          Recent development in W-Lab is learning profiles

          <p>We have the learning profiles.</p>
          <p>People are collaboratively learning through the learning profiles.</p>
          <p>
            We study when a learner should be pushed, when not to be pushed anymore,
            and when it is still beneficial to push a little.
          </p>
          <p>
            We measure whether someone is doing the maximum of what they could for their learning.
          </p>
          <p>
            We measure the effort the learner puts in — not only the results — focusing on what is controllable by the learner.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the long term, this creates a more balanced, emotionally stable competence assessment.
